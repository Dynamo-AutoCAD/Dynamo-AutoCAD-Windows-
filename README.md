## 🧠 Overview

**Dynamo for AutoCAD** is a visual scripting extension that introduces rule-based logic and automation into standard CAD workflows. Instead of writing traditional code, users build logic using a node-based interface where actions, parameters, and data are connected visually.

This approach allows designers and engineers to automate repetitive drafting tasks, generate parametric geometry, and control complex drawing behavior with consistency. Dynamo operates directly inside AutoCAD, making it possible to modify existing drawings or create new geometry driven by logical relationships.

Dynamo is widely used in computational design, architectural workflows, and engineering automation where flexibility, repeatability, and data-driven control significantly improve productivity on Windows-based AutoCAD systems.

## Additional Information for Windows Users

Dynamo allows AutoCAD users to shift from manual editing to logic-driven design. Once a graph is created, changes can be applied instantly by adjusting parameters, making it ideal for iterative design and rapid revisions.

For Windows users working with complex CAD standards, repetitive layouts, or parametric concepts, Dynamo provides a powerful bridge between design intent and automated execution inside AutoCAD.
